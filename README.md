Documentation about the objection Engine and the Twitter bots ecosystem

## What is objection engine?
[Objection engine](https://github.com/LuisMayo/objection_engine) is a python library aimed at rendering Ace Attorney-like videos given a list of comments.

## What uses does objection engine has?
The "official" uses, this means the uses I personally give the engine are mainly bots. More specifically three bots.

- A Twitter Bot: https://github.com/LuisMayo/ace-attorney-twitter-bot
- A Telegram Bot: https://github.com/LuisMayo/ace-attorney-telegram-bot
- A Discord bot: https://github.com/LuisMayo/ace-attorney-discord-bot

There are other uses, like an VK bot. But they're not maintained by me.
